# Week 1 Code Challenge - JavaScript Practice

## 📋 Description

This repository contains my solutions for the **Week 1 JavaScript Code Challenges**, designed to help practice core JavaScript skills such as:

- Getting user input using `prompt()`
- Using functions and arguments
- Applying arithmetic operations
- Implementing conditionals
- Outputting user-friendly messages to the console

Each challenge is stored in its own folder for easy navigation and modularity.
